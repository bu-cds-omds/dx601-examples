        "* Each increase in the labelers' estimated flavor will increase the predicted flavor of this model by 0.8.\n",
        "* For the other two columns, the prediction changes by 0.2 for each increase by one in the respective column, but it increases by 0.2 for estimated sweetness, and decreases by 0.2 for wrinkles, because the latter coefficient is negative.\n",

        "* First, many of these columns are probably correlated.\n",
        "* Like softness, estimated sweetness and estimated flavor.\n",
        "* Even how yellow the mango is.\n",
        "* All of those would be driven by how ripe the mango is, but we don't have a direct measure of ripeness.\n",
        "* We will talk about correlations from a couple different angles during this module.\n",
        "* Second, the estimate columns from the labelers are potentially unreliable, since they depend on human judgment and individual tastes.\n",
        "* If we have an expert mango labeler, they might be able to give us great estimates, but we should not fool ourselves thinking that any labeler will give us great estimates.\n"
